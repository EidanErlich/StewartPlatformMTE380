# MTE 380 Stewart Platform Project

A 3-servo Stewart platform with inverse kinematics implementation and interactive 3D visualization.

## Features

- Inverse kinematics calculation for a 3-servo circular Stewart platform
- Interactive 3D visualization using matplotlib
- Real-time control with arrow keys
- Configurable link lengths and platform geometry

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Virtual Environment

Run the setup script to create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
bash setup_env.sh
```
```

## Running the Visualization

Once the environment is set up and activated:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 inverseKinematics.py
```
